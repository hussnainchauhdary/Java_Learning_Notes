# Java Learning Notes

**This repository contains my Java learning notes and code examples while I study core Java programming and object‑oriented concepts.**

I am currently a BS Computer Science student working step by step to build strong fundamentals in Java so I can progress towards advanced topics and prepare for real software engineering roles.

## 🚀 What I’m Learning Next

I plan to continue working on:
- **Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP)**: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces.
- **Collections Framework**: ArrayList, HashMap, Sets, etc.
- **Exception Handling**
- **File I/O**
- **Mini projects** after OOP
